# Zukyc

This is an example app using POD & GPC.
For details about POD & GPC, see [this doc](https://zupass.org/pod).

## Example use case

This example app demonstrates an end to end use case for POD & GPC. The story goes, Gerry the giraffe would like to borrow some money, so he goes to [ZooLender](https://zukyc-gpc-verifier.vercel.app). ZooLender wants him to prove that he has a valid ID, and has annual income over $20,000 amount among other things. Gerry doesn't know ZooLender well. He doesn't feel comfortable to send him his ID and paystubs. So they decide to use [ZooKyc](https://zukyc-gpc-prover-client.vercel.app) (KYC stands for [Know Your Customer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer)).

ZooKyc manages the user's identity (e.g. [Semaphore identity](https://docs.semaphore.pse.dev/V3/guides/identities)), PODs, and generate proofs upon requests.

To use ZooKyc, Gerry first goes to [ZooGov](https://zukyc-issuer-client.vercel.app/gov) (a govenment website), and ZooGov issues him a govenment ID POD signed by ZooGov. Gerry then goes to [ZooDeel](https://zukyc-issuer-client.vercel.app/deel) (a payroll service provider website), and ZooDeel issues him a paystub POD signed by ZooDeel. All the PODs have a owner field with Gerry's Semaphore public identity.

ZooLender provides Gerry a proof request which specifics what he wants Gerry to prove about the govenment ID POD and the paystub POD.

Gerry then goes to ZooKyc with his ID POD, Paystub POD, and the proof request from ZooLender. ZooKyc creates a zero knowledge proof that Gerry has a valid ID, and has annual income over $20,000 amount without leaking other information. ZooKyc is a browser only app. In fact, Gerry can take the code from ZooKyc and run it himself.

Now with the proof generated by ZooKyc, Gerry goes back to ZooLender. ZooLender verifies the proof, and lends Gerry the money.

You can walk through Gerry's experience using the deployed app links below.

## Deployed app

- [ZooLender](https://zukyc-gpc-verifier.vercel.app): a lending website. To apply for a loan, the user can use ZooKyc to generate a proof with the proof request ZooLender provides. ZooLender will verify the proof, and decide whether to lend the user the money.
- [ZooKyc](https://zukyc-gpc-prover-client.vercel.app): manages the user's identity, PODs, and generate proofs upon requests.
- [ZooGov](https://zukyc-issuer-client.vercel.app/gov): a govenment website. It can issue govenment ID POD.
- [ZooDeel](https://zukyc-issuer-client.vercel.app/deel): a payroll service provider website. It can issue paystub POD.
- [ZooAdmin](https://zukyc-issuer-client.vercel.app/debug): for debugging purposes. It allows you to generate govenment ID POD and paystub POD with the information you provide.

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following apps (inside the `apps/` folder):

### POD issuers (ZooGov, ZooDeel, ZooAdmin)

#### `pod-issuer-client`

- http://localhost:3000, deployed at https://zukyc-issuer-client.vercel.app. It includes:
- [ZooGov](https://zukyc-issuer-client.vercel.app/gov): Govenment ID POD issuer.
- [ZooDeel](https://zukyc-issuer-client.vercel.app/deel): Paystub POD issuer.
- [ZooAdmin](https://zukyc-issuer-client.vercel.app/debug): For debugging purposes, it allows you to generate ID PODs and Paystub PODs with the information you provide.
- `pod-issuer-server`: http://localhost:8080, deployed at https://zukyc-issuer-server.vercel.app.
  - This is the Express server for pod-issuer-client. It provides the APIs to issues PODs to the user.

### ZooKyc

- `gpc-prover-client` (ZooKyc): http://localhost:3002, deployed at https://zukyc-gpc-prover-client.vercel.app.
  - This is a Next.js app which uses the GPC library to generate ZK proofs. GPCs can prove properties of one POD or serveral PODs together. PODs can be proven to be owned by the prover, using their Semaphore identity.

### ZooLender

- `gpc-verifier` (ZooLender): http://localhost:3001, deployed at https://zukyc-gpc-verifier.vercel.app.
  - This is a Next.js app which uses the GPC library to verify ZK proofs.
  - I didn't build a server side app for this, because the verification code would be similar. But in reality, the proof needs to be verified on the server side too.
